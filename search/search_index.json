Using behavior observers (See Behaviors section ). Please refer to the cpp sample and more specifically cpp_sample.cpp for a sample about using qan :: Graph topology related methods. Defining Custom Topology \u00b6 QuickQanava topology is described using GTpo library. Topology is modelled using non visual objects modelling node ( qan::Node connected by directed edges ( qan::Edge eventually grouped in qan::Group . These non-visual objects (called primitives) are mapped to QML QQuickItem based visual items. Concrete QQuickItem are generated on demand using QML QQmlComponent objects. QuickQanava provide default delegates for all primitives, but custom delegate could be specify by providing an argument for all primitive creation functions: qan :: Graph :: insertNode () , qan :: Graph :: insertEdge () , qan :: Graph :: insertGroup () and their QML counterpart in Qan . Graph . Simple custom delegate mapping is described in custom nodes and custom groups sections. Primitives classes could be subclassed from c++ to provide specific customization. Mapping between non-visual topology primitive and their QtQuick counterpart is managed trought static singleton factories defined in qan :: Node , qan :: Edge and qan :: Group . Theses factories are automatically called from qan :: Graph when a primitive creation request happen: a visual item with a specific style is then automatically created. Creation of a custom graph (MyGraph) with custom node (MyNode) and a dedicated visual item (MyNodeItem) could be achieved with the following architecture: Factories have to be redefined in primitive subclasses: static QQmlComponent * delegate ( QQmlEngine & engine ) noexcept : Return a (usually singleton) QML component that will be used for primitive visual delegate. static qan :: NodeStyle * style () noexcept : Return a (usually singleton) style used as primitive default style. Custom content is then created from a specialized qan :: Graph class: 1 2 3 4 5 // class MyGraph : public qan::Graph ... qan :: Node * MyGraph :: insertMyNode () noexcept { return insertNode < MyNode > () } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 // In a custom MyNode.cpp defining MyNode (inheriting from qan::Node) QQmlComponent * MyNode :: delegate ( QQmlEngine & engine ) noexcept { static std :: unique_ptr < QQmlComponent > MyNode_delegate ; if ( !

Insertion of non Visual Content \u00b6 Non visual edge or node could be used in graph to model complex topologies or add internal non-visual logic with: qan :: Graph :: insertNonVisualNode <> () : default graph nodeDelegate will no be used, custom node delegate () may be oeither undefined or return nullptr. qan :: Graph :: insertNonVisualEdge <> ( source , destination ) : Edge could be a regular node -> node edge or an oriented hyper edge node -> edge. Observation of Topological Modifications \u00b6 QuickQanava provide a full observation interface with the qan::Behaviour concept to react when underlying graph topology is modified.

For example, any view connected to a node outNodes model is automatically updated when a directed edge is inserted from that node to another one.","title":"Data Model"},{"location":"graph.html#quickqanava-initialization","text":"QuickQanava should be initialized in your c++ main function: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 #include <QuickQanava> int main ( int argc , char * argv []) { QGuiApplication app ( argc , argv ); QQuickStyle :: setStyle ( \"Material\" ); QQmlApplicationEngine engine ; // Or in a custom QQuickView constructor: QuickQanava :: initialize (); engine . load ( ... ); return app . exec (); } Then, in QML import QuickQanava: 1 2 import QuickQanava 2.0 as Qan import \"qrc:/QuickQanava\" as Qan And create a Qan .

Docks and Ports \u00b6 Docks and ports could be used to control how an edge is connected to source and destination node: A dock Qan . DockItem is a visual group of ports. QuickQanava define 4 ports identified by their position: Qan.NodeItem.Left / Qan.NodeItem.Top / Qan.NodeItem.Right / Qan.NodeItem.Bottom. A port Qan . PortItem is a graphical item attached to a node in a specific port that could receive in edge or \"emit\" out edges. A dock can have multiple ports with port.type beeing either PortItem.In (only input edge), PortItem.Out (only out edge) or PortItem.InOut. Docks and ports are managed trought the Qan.Graph interface: Qan . Graph . insertPort ( node , orientation ) : Insert a port on node at a given orientation and return a Qan . PortItem . Qan . Graph . bindEdgeDestination ( edge , port ) : Bind an edge destination on a given port . Qan . Graph . bindEdgeSource ( edge , port ) : Bind an edge source on a given port .

Node Resizing \u00b6 Node resizing behaviour could be configured with the following Qan.NodeItem (or qan::NodeItem) properties: Qan . NodeItem . resizable / qan :: NodeItem :: setResizable () : Enable or disable node item resizing (default to true , ie node is resizable). Qan . NodeItem . ratio / qan :: NodeItem :: setRatio () : Set the node \"allowed\" resizing ratio when visual resizing is enabled. Ratio is witdh / height ratio that is allowed during visual resizing operations. Ratio conservation is disabled if ratio is < 0. ratio default to -1, ie ratio is not conserved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Component . onCompleted : { // Qan.Graph.Component.onCompleted() var n1 = graph . insertNode () n1 . item . resizable = false // n1 is not resizable var n2 = graph . insertNode () n2 . item . resizable = true // n2 is resizable (setting to true is // not mandatory, it's the default behaviour) n2 . item . ratio = 0.5 // node resizing will maintain a width/height ratio // of 0.5, ie height will alays be half of width. } Default resizer color could be configured in Qan . GraphView using the following properties: resizeHandlerColor (color): Color of the visual drop node component (could be set to Material.accent for example) Node defining custom delegate resizing will be handled automatically by the framework. Complete customization of the resizing behaviour of custom nodes is possible using the Qan . BottomRightResizer component directly from custom delegates (See Bottom Right Resizer ). Observing Topology \u00b6 Node related topology changes could be observed at graph or node level in the following ways: Overloading dedicated methods in qan :: Graph : onNodeInserted () , onNodeRemoved () , default implementation is empty. Binding to properties: qan :: Graph :: nodes :: length : Number of node actually registered in graph (observable QML property). qan :: Node :: inDegree / qan :: Node :: outDegree : In/out degree of a node updated in real-time, binded to a Qt Quick property useable from QML. qan :: Node :: inNodes / qan :: Node :: outNodes : Observable container of in/out nodes (in/out degree is inNodes.length/outNodes.length). Binding to signals qan :: Graph :: nodeInserted () and qan :: Graph :: nodeRemoved () . Selection \u00b6 Selection can be modified at graph level just by changing the graph selection policy property Qan . Graph . selectionPolicy : Qan . AbstractGraph . NoSelection : Selection will be disabled in the whole graph. Qan . AbstractGraph . SelectOnClick : Node are selected when clicked, multiple selection is enabled when CTRL is pressed. Qan . AbstractGraph . SelectOnCtrlClick : Node are selected only if CTRL is pressed when node is clicked (multiple selection is still available). Selection can also be configured with the following Qan.Graph properties: Qan . Graph . selectionColor / qan :: Graph :: setSelectionColor () : Color for the node selection rectangle. Qan . Graph . selectionWeight / qan :: Graph :: setSelectionWeight () : Border width of the node selection rectangle. Qan . Graph . selectionMargin / qan :: Graph :: setSelectionMargin () : Margin between the node selection rectangle and the node content (selection weight is taken into account). All theses properties could be changed dynamically. Selection could also be disabled at node level by setting Qan . Node . selectable property to false , node become unselectable even if global graph selection policy Qan . Graph . selectionPolicy is set to something else than NoSelection . Current multiple selection (or single selection) is available through Qan.Graph selectedNodes property. selectedNodes is a list model, it can be used in any QML view, or iterated from C++ to read the current selection: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 // Viewing the currently selected nodes with a QML ListView: ListView { id : selectionListView Layout . fillWidth : true ; Layout . fillHeight : true clip : true model : graph . selectedNodes // <--------- spacing : 4 ; focus : true ; flickableDirection : Flickable .

ListView . view . currentIndex = index } } } } In C++, selectedNodes could be iterated directly, the current node should be tested to ensure it is non nullptr, since the underlining model is thread-safe and could have been modified from another thread: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 auto graph = std :: make_unique < qan :: Graph > (); for ( auto & node : graph -> getSelectNodes () ) { if ( node != nullptr ) node -> doWhateverYouWant (); } // Or better: for ( const auto & node : qAsConst ( graph -> getSelectNodes ()) ) { if ( node != nullptr ) node -> doWhateverYouWantConst (); } Example of Qan . AbstractGraph . SelectOnClick selection policy with multiple selection dragging inside a group: Defining Custom Nodes \u00b6 Refer to custom . qml file in Nodes sample for more information regarding configuration and installation of specifics custom delegates for nodes and edges. When defining custom nodes with complex geometry (ie. non rectangular), there is multiple ways to take bounding shape generation into account : Using the default behavior for rectangular node with complexBoundingShape set to false (default value), bounding shape is automatically generated on node width or height change in generateDefaultBoundingShape () . Using dedicated code by setting complexBoundingShape to true and with a call to \\c setBoundingShape() from a custom onRequestUpdateBoundingShape() signal handler. Note that signal requestUpdateBoundingShape won't be emitted for non complex bounding shape. Optionally, you could choose to set complexBoundingShape to false and override generateDefaultBoundingShape () method. Grouping Nodes \u00b6 Default Groups \u00b6 Groups are a specific kind of nodes that can contains mutliple regular nodes. Groups are created using Qan . Graph . insertGroup () method. Nodes are ususally inserted into existing groups visually by dragging and dropping a node inside a group. Group topology could also be modified from C++ using qan :: Graph :: groupNode () and qan :: Graph :: ungroupNode () API. Group visual item ( Qan . GroupItem ) is accessible from Qan . Group . item property, the API is fully consistent with nodes. A group could have a custom label (editable directly from the default delegate using Quick Controls 2 text input) and could be collapsed visually using the Qan . GroupItem . collapsed property. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Qan .

Group : Group . resizable or qan :: GroupItem :: resizable : Enable or disable visual group resizing. Group . labelEditorVisible ( QML only ) : Show or hide the group label visualization and edition visual component (label is editable by default). Group . expandButtonVisible ( QML only ) : Show or hide the group default delegate expand/collapse button (button is visible by default). Group sizing is managed automatically by the framework to prevent resizing group below it's content contentsRect . Group size should not be modified directly trough standard quick items width and height properties, instead use: GroupItem . preferredGroupWidth / GroupItem . preferredGroupHeight : Initial group size (should be used instead of setting group item width/height directly), default to (250x200). GroupItem . minimumGroupWidth / GroupItem . minimumGroupHeight : Group can't be resized below specified width/height, default to (150x100). Refer to Group Sample for more detailled informations. Custom Groups \u00b6 GroupItem is build using Qan . RectGroupTemplate template, a custom group delegate with full selection/resizing and styling support could easily be built using this template, see the Qan.Group component implementation for a demonstration. A group visual delegate could be built completely from scratch, by inheriting a component from Qan . GroupItem or directly from qan :: GroupItem class, but the following interface must be configured to enable node drag and drop and complete integration in QuickQanava framework: Qan . GroupItem . container or qan :: GroupItem :: container must be binded to a QuickItem acting as a group concrete container, otherwise visual drag and drop of nodes won't works (Mandatory). Custom group item should react to signals onNodeDragEnter () and onNodeDragLeave () when a candidate node is dragged above the group to send a visual feedback to the user (Optional).
